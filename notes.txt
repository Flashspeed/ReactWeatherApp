Error "Can't resolve 'fs'":
    ERROR in ./node_modules/dotenv/lib/main.js
    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'fs' in 'K:\Documents and Files\PHPStorm_Workspace\react_weather_app\node_modules\dotenv\lib'

    This error occurs because the dotenv developers have not implemented support for client side environment variables
    link https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/issues/224#issuecomment-327617035 a workaround is to use
    dotenv-webpack (Link https://github.com/mrsteele/dotenv-webpack) instead as
    suggested by Link https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/issues/172#issuecomment-331066918

For this project
    "npm run build":
        Will put the bundled files from the "src" folder into the "dist" folder.

    "npm run start":
        Will start the dev server and open the browser with the app loaded in. No files will be put in the
        "dist" folder since the dev server loads all the bundled files in memory instead. This is for fast
        hot reloading without refreshing the web page.
